<p>I was born in Colorado and attended Brigham Young University for college.  I majored
in elementary education, and now I teach three students: my Heidi, my Peter, and my Austin.</p>

<p>I'm married to a web developer and we live in the Mid-West.  </p>

<p>I love to eat, read, and sleep. Back to basics, right?</p>
