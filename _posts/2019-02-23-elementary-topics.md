title: Elementary School Science and Social Studies Topics

I have this habit of getting interested (read: obsessed) with high-detail, repetative projects where I'm filled with self-doubt because I don't know if anyone ever will benefit from my effort. 

Here is my most recent. It is a map of elementary science and social studies topics from the Ohio state standards documents. I felt compelled to read through them all and boil each one down to just a few words and then put them on a single sheet.
