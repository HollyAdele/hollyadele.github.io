## Treasure Island

What happens in Chapters 2-5:

2. A pirate named Black Dog comes to
visit Billy Bones. The two fight. Black
Dog runs away. Doctor Livesey tells
Captain Billy Bones that if he keeps
drinking rum, he will die.

3. Jim’s father dies. A blind pirate brings
“the black spot” to Billy Bones. Billy
Bones dies.

4. Jim and his mother discover the black
spot, which says that Billy Bones has until
10 pm that night. No one from town will
help them, so they go alone to Billy Bones’
chest. Jim’s mother will only take enough
money to cover what she is owed, but Jim
also grabs an oilskin packet of papers.
They they run away and hide under a
bridge.

5. The pirates return, led by blind Pew,
and ransack the Admiral Benbow, looking
for the oilskin packet and Jim. When the
police arrive on horseback, the pirates scatter, leaving Pew to be trampled by Mr. Dance’s horse.
