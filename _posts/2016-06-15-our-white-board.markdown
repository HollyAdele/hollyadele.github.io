title: Our White Board

We have a white board in our kitchen.  It's not the most fashionable kitchen decor out there, but it's really been awesome for homeschooling (which we are for at least the next eight months while we live in the school district that we do.)

It's amazing.  It's how direct instruction was meant to be. They want to come near the board because they are hungry.  They are quiet because they have food in their mouth.  We don't use the white board every day, but when we do, we make things like this:

You have to talk about _something_ while you eat.
