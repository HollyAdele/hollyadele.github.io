Kids can change the world! Kids see things that grownups don't. Watch this movie about [The Boy who Harnessed the Wind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stjOzn1etjc). 

Working together makes us think better. We can learn to work together well. 

If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. This is going to be really hard. But I have recorded hours of video doing the project myself, and we will all help each other. 


For this activity, we’re going to get a bunch of kids together to share ideas about problems. We’ll get together online so more kids can join us, as long as they obey Scratch Community Guidelines. There are two parts to this activity: making Scratch Projects about a problem, and commenting our ideas on each other’s projects.

You can make a project about any problem you choose. If you need some help thinking of a problem, here are some [problem ideas](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1204121760).  Use this project to help you [keep track of your next step](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1205170273). If the problems make you feel big feelings, use this project to [figure out which feeling](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1204652919) it is. Share your feelings with a family member or friend. Here is a video on [how to research your topic and use ChatGPT safely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LM1Rw8KbG98). Here are links to the websites for [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), [Simple Wikipedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), and [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/).

Here is a [sample project about Plastic Waste in the Ocean](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1204771546) that I made. Here is a [video showing you how to make it yourself](https://youtu.be/fTWKGd7bGqM).

Submit your project to [our Scratch Studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/50755575/). If you have a problem, add WIP (work in progress) to the beginning of the title and say what problem you're having in the "Notes and Credits" box. Others can comment and give you help. Here is a project telling you how I will [grade your projects](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1206949724). Halfway through the unit I'll let you know what grade your Scratch project will get. Tell me when you are ready for me to grade it again for a better score. 

 We can only work together if we follow the [Scratch Communtiy Guidelines](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1204176530). Here is a project telling you how I will [grade your comments](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1206957108). You can also comment on a project if you have any ideas to fix the problem.
