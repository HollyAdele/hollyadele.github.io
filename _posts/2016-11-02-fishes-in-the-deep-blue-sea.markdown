title: Fishes in the Deep Blue Sea

I'm learning JavaScript, and here is my second project. My first is [here](http://codepen.io/HollyAdele/full/QGLOQx/).

Austin loves the song, "There are so many fishes in the deep blue sea! What color fishie do you see?" "Blue." "Blue!  Blue.  This one's blue.  This little fishie is blue.  There are so many..."

It works like a charm to calm him down.  So I'm coding a silly game for him with a JavaScript... thingie... that I learned.

For it I need these images to be on the web.  (I made them!)

![blue fish](/post-images/fishes/blue-fish.jpg)
![green fish](/post-images/fishes/green-fish.jpg)
![purple fish](/post-images/fishes/purple-fish.jpg)
![red fish](/post-images/fishes/red-fish.jpg)
![white fish](/post-images/fishes/white-fish.jpg)
![yellow fish](/post-images/fishes/yellow-fish.jpg)
![deep blue sea](/post-images/fishes/sea.jpg)

If you really want to, you can see the game [here](http://codepen.io/HollyAdele/full/ZBzoZp/).
