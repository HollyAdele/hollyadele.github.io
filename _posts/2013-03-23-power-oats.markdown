From a suggestion from [Mr. Money Mustache,](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/08/23/grocery-shopping-with-your-middle-finger/) we have a new breakfast. It's called Power Oats.

Take a banana, slice it lengthwise as for a banana split.  Then slice it lengthwise again so you have four long banana strips.  Then cut the strips into small pieces, and put them in your bowl.

Shake in some quick oats, uncooked, straight out of the can, into your bowl.  Stir to coat all the banana pieces, then cover with whole milk.  You really have to use whole milk.

Bananas, oats, milk. That's it!

I've run numbers on Power Oats compared to cereal (It was either Lucky Charms or Honey Bunches of Oats), and Power Oats with whole milk came in at half the calories of cereal with skim milk.

I haven't run the numbers on cost, but I'm pretty sure Power Oats win because you eat way less oats than cereal.  You really can't eat more than a cup of oats and a whole banana, but I'm pretty sure I can eat three cups of cereal. 

Substitute strawberries, or blackberries, or blueberries, or raisins, or craisins, or apple cubes, for the bananas.

So, laugh if you must (and some have) but if you're looking to cut some dollars or calories, this is a good way to go.
