This is going to be an extremely nerdy post.

My husband showed me [this weird game](
http://flippybitandtheattackofthehexadecimalsfrombase16.com/
).

And he didn't tell me how to play it, but he told me I had all the tools I needed.

And I figured it out.  I figured out how to switch from hexidecimals to binary, and do it quickly.  I still remember the feeling when that final synapse forged a connection, and then I felt like I had to stay up way past a reasonable bedtime to beat the game.

I searched the internet, including a reddit forum, and as far as I know, I hold the high score. (My old high score is there at the top, but the new one is down at the bottom next to the little guy.)
