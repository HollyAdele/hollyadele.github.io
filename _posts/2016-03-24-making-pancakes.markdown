Heidi lives for Tuesdays, her dish day. If she hears me cooking she begs to help.

Here she is [making pancakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUYSGojUuAU).

That ice pack is out because I burned myself moving the griddle because she knocked it off the counter two years ago and broke off one handle because I wasn't watching her properly because she usually didn't get into trouble.

Here she is with the stack of pancakes she made, while reading [this](http://www.amazon.com/Disney-Fairies-Graphic-Novel-Prillas/dp/1597071862).
