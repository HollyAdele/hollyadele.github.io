title: Austin Helps with Groceries

Sweet little Austin helps me every time I bring in groceries.  (We park a distance away from our front door, and my grocery store doesn't give out bags for free, so I drag my groceries in the wagon.)  It works well.

This time I was doing something else, and came back to find that Austin had sorted all the groceries by type.
