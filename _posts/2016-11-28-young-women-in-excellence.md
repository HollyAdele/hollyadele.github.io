I want to show you what I made while I was completing my Knowledge project.  I learned a bit of JavaScript, and while practicing I made some games for my kids.

[Austin's Favorite Song](http://hollybraun.com/apps/fishies.html) <br>
Austin loves to sing [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nao86eOi264) with me.  It can calm him down during all but the worst diaper changes. <br>

[A counting game for Peter,](http://hollybraun.com/apps/lets-count.html)  <br>
Peter enjoys watching things count up.  He'll tap that button hundreds of times.<br>

[A spelling game for Heidi](http://hollybraun.com/apps/spelling-game.html). <br>
I wanted Heidi to practice ways to spell verb digraphs.  She knows when a word looks right, but not which vowel combinations to try.  <br>

[Play Primary Songs](http://hollybraun.com/apps/primary-songs.html). <br>
A simple Primary Song player. <br>

[Name That Primary Song](http://hollybraun.com/apps/name-that-primary-song.html). <br>
And, the most difficult so far, Name That Primary Song.  As far as I know, this is the only app of this game on the internet.  I used to love playing this game in Primary, and could never get enough. (I think I've gotten enough now.) <br>
