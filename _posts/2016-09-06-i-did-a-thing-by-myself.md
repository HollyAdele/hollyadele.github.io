title: I did a thing by myself!

In setting up this website, I got a lot of help from my husband Bryan, who is a professional web developer.  But today I made something by myself!

I wanted my readers to be able know when I write a blog post.  So I don't have to nag my family and friends.

It was not easy!  I poked around on my blog and deleted things and added things and I'm not 100% sure of everything I did.  And then I watched a video of a person in India who was trying to send an email to followers of his Jekyll blog (just like mine), and the thing that he did was one of the same things that I tried... so I tried it again and it worked this time.

Whatever.

Anyway, if you'll observe, now below my face on the pink sidebar is an envelope.  If you click it, you can give me your email address and then you'll know every time I write a post!  Yay.
