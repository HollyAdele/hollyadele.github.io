FamilySearch has developed some fun [activities](https://www.familysearch.org/discovery/) that my kids like. 

Here is "Picture My Heritage." 

![A photo of 8 old fashioned young women posing together with bouquets. Except the faces of the young women can be replaced with a photo of a face the user takes. My son took random pictures of himself. A huge mouth, a finger up his nose, silly things like that.](/post-images/family-history-6-austin.jpg)

I think it's probably okay if they are super silly about this. I think they'll remember that they had fun during Family Family History Time and slowly grow into making actual progress someday. Also, they did this independently so I had time to work one-on-one with another child on a more difficult family history project.
