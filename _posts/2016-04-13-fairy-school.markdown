According to Heidi, princesses are out.  Fairies are in!

So it's not Princess Academy anymore, it's Fairy School.  If you haven't read the Disney Fairy series, then I'll tell you that the fairy society at Pixie Hollow is organized around the fairies' talents.  There are baking-talent fairies, garden-talent fairies, cleaning-talent fairies, animal-talent fairies, decorating-talent fairies, and so on.

So we are finding out what kind of fairy Heidi is.  We'll try gardening, baking, math, reading, cleaning, fixing things, sports, art, music, dancing, programming, and friendship.
