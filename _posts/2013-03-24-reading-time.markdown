I've solved 78% of our bedtime battles (for the time being).  At 7pm, kids get ready for bed and then they have Reading Time.  And then they get to read for an hour or so.  They like it because it feels like bedtime is pushed back, we like it because they spend a lot of time reading.  Win, win.

These pictures aren't of Reading Time at night, but if I catch my kids reading together you better believe I'm taking a picture of it.
