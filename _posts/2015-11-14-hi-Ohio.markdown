We moved!  Seven months ago.  I've been waiting until I set up this website to blog 
about it.

Bryan was hoping to take his career in a new direction, and we always knew we didn't
want to pay Northern Virginia's housing prices forever.

The kids and I spent many evenings shut in a back bedroom trying not to yell while
Bryan conversed with possible employers about how much he rocks.  He settled on [Sparkbox]
(http://www.seesparkbox.com) and then we settled here.

We thought it would be exciting to serve for a little while in an inner city branch,
and we were certainly right! They're keeping us busy and we love the experiences
we are having.
