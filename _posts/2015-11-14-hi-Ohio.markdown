We moved!  Seven months ago.  I've been waiting until I set up this website to blog
about it.

Bryan was hoping to take his career in a new direction, and we always knew we didn't
want to pay Northern Virginia's housing prices forever.

The kids and I spent many evenings shut in a back bedroom trying not to yell while
Bryan conversed with possible employers about how much he rocks.  He settled on [Sparkbox](http://www.seesparkbox.com) and then we settled here.

We thought it would be exciting to serve for a little while in an inner city branch,
and we were certainly right! They're keeping us busy and we love the experiences
we are having.

Here are some pictures for your viewing pleasure:
