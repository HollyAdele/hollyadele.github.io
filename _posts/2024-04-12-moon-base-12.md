During the first summer of the pandemic, I experimented with Project Based Learning. We pretended that we were astronauts on the moon, and the video is giving a tour of the base. In creating the scripts, the props, and the footage, the children learned the science. I [blogged](https://www.hollybraun.com/2020/05/15/summer-learning.html) about it at length and finally uploaded the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjwMVdA1Hm4) to YouTube.
