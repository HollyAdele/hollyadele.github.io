What makes delightful cookie dough?  

Start with 1/2 cup butter (Weekly Activities).  Butter is what attracts us to the cookie dough.  It makes us keep coming back every week for more.

Mix in 1/4 cup granulated sugar (Kindness).  Add it a little at a time.  Nobody doesn't want sugar!  And nobody doesn't want a friend.

Sometimes the kindness runs out.  If you attend church with humans, then offense and grudges are going to happen.  (Dirt).  Do you want to put it in your cookie dough?  You can...

Perhaps you prefer forgiveness instead (1/2 cup brown sugar).  Yes, forgiveness tastes much better than dirt.  You are in charge of what you add to your own cookie dough- and you are the one who will eat it.  

Add 3 T of milk (Young Women's Camp).

Every ward has a flavor.  Is it welcoming?  Is it judgmental?  Is it warm?  Is it appreciative?  Once again, you are in charge of the flavor.  (1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla)

Add 1 cup flour (Sunday Meetings).  Flour makes bread, and bread sustains life.  Come to church every week for your bread which will sustain you.  Don't skip a meal!  Your spirit will be so empty and sad.

Finally, 1 cup chocolate chips.  Chocolate chips stand for Personal Progress.  Each experience and project is done one at a time, and it turns you into who you want to be.  One is not enough, two is not enough.  You want chocolate chips in every bite of cookie dough, so put Personal Progress in every week.  

The blessings of your Young Women's Organization are ready to enjoy.  Don't forget to share those blessings with young women who didn't get any tonight, or last week, or the week before.
