Peter came home from school with a fun game: dollar words. The letter "A" is worth one cent, the letter "B" is worth two cents, and so on. You add up the values of the letters of the word and if it comes to 100, it's a dollar word. 

I got nerd sniped, and instantly needed to write a program to calculate a word's value. This escalated into a program to find every single dollar word in the English language. 

I found a dictionary online with tens of thousands of English words. Then I wrote a program to look at each word, calculate the value, then write it down and count how many. 

There are 4,625 dollar words in English. Abatements, acquitted, abettors, acclimation, accumulate, acknowledge, addressing, adulthood, and Afghanistan are the only words I expect to ever use from the first column. There are eighty columns. Abomasusi, ansinthol, and acceptavit: I do not expect to ever use.

This makes me feel like my vocabulary actually isn't that large. And it makes me wonder who compiled this list. 

Most likely, we made a robot do it.

Oddly enough, I keep needing this program in my life, so I [put it on Github](https://github.com/HollyAdele/dollar-word-calc) so I will always know where it is, and others can use it and help me with it.
