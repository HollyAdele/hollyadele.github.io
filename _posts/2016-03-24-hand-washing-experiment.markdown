title: Hand Washing Experiment

I am a bit of a germ freak.  Made worse by the fact that germs ruin my life. Germs turn my normally delightful children into leaky, yelling, unmanageable creatures.  Doctors tell me I can avoid this unfortunate transformation by hand washing.

One winter the kids and I were sick every other week.  When I started washing my hands for 20 seconds--we stopped getting sick so often.  What, is washing hands for just a few seconds not really doing anything at all?  Perhaps.  Gross.

Well, my mom sent me a present which has the potential to change my life.  It's a silver [microfiber hand drying cloth](http://www.amazon.com/Norwex-Chenille-Microfiber-Childrens-Yellow/dp/B016XIWRWQ) which I thought was a lion but apparently is a tiger.  The fibers are 1/200th the size of hair, so they trap particles quickly.  Apparently interweaved with these tiny fibers are also tiny silver fibers?  That's what they say.  Supposedly the silver kills the microorganisms trapped in the microfibers.  So you just wet the surface and wipe it down and then it's cleaner than if you had bleached or lysolled it.

Being the homeschooling germ freak that I am, I also needed to test it on hands.  I heard about a first grader doing an experiment like this, so must be legit, right?

The basic idea is that the kids play outside, then either wash with soap and water, hand sanitizer, or the Norwex Liger.

Supplies

- 12 pieces of Potato
- Bags
- Soap
- Towel
- Norwex microfiber Lion
- hand sanitizer
- water in a bottle
- a public playground
- a sandbox

Heidi's job was to gather germs from the sandbox, while Peter canvassed the play structure.  They did great.

I put a potato in a bag right as we got there as a control.  They played with a potato before we left the car and bagged it too, as more controls.  Is that a thing?

They played for 20 minutes, then handled another potato and bagged it, then washed hands and bagged another potato.  More playing, then we wet hands and dried on the Liger.  More playing, then just hand sanitizer.

I already see a difference in enzymatic browning, which may or may not ruin everything.  We shall see.

Potato Bags

1. Has not been played with
2. Baseline clean H
3. Baseline clean P
4. Baseline dirty 30 minutes of playground
5. Baseline dirty 30 minutes pf sand
6. 20 seconds of soap after playground
7. 20 seconds of soap after sand
8. Wet Lion after playground
9. Wet Lion after sand
10. Hand sanitizer after playground
11. Hand sanitizer after sand

They're on a box on top of our fridge. (Remind me to check on them.) The number of germ colonies growing should be related to the effectiveness of the hand-cleaning method, right?  I will get back to you about Norwex soon.

But, sorry Norwex, e-Cloths get similar reviews but are cheaper.  So, if this experiment plays out, the next time I need to buy cleaning supplies, I will probably buy an e-Cloth instead.
