title: Teaching Children to Solve Rubik's Cubes

I taught my second child how to solve a Rubik's Cube. I learned how to solve them in 2016. My friends and I got obsessed with them and would race each other. Winner gets dinner. 

I learned from [Noah Richardson's Youtube video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPzzGPXW8fs&feature=youtu.be) These markings will make sense after you watch the video.
