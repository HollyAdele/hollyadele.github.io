My parents visited a little while ago, and it was so good to see them.

A few months ago, they had a dumpster parked at their house for a while.  When the truck came to pick it up, my dad filmed it because he thought the kids would like it.

They did.

This happened very often those two weeks.  Almost continuously.  It would have been continuously if the kids had had their way.
