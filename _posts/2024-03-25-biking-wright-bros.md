title: Biking to Wright Brother Sites

Three or four years ago, I made a goal to bike to all the Wright Brothers sites in Dayton. 

I made it to Carillon Park, where a flyer is kept. Along with (a replica of?) their bike shop. I haven't biked to the spot where their house was, and I most certainly will not bike to Detroit and pay $35 to see their actual house. (The $35 is the worst part.)

And their mansion, where they spent their last sad days fighting patent cases.

And the hospital where one brother died early.

Also Woodland Cemetery, where they are buried.

On a happier note, I get to ride with a high school group to these sites! My son was involved in this group last year and he hated it. What the heck? Who could hate biking? Not me.
