title: Family History for Kids Activity 3 - Take names to the temple

When children are small, pretending is really powerful. For Family Home Evening one week, we "found" "names" and took them to the "temple".

They needed to answer interview questions to get their recommends.

I hid these pictures from the Friend around the room, and the children found them.

They took the names they found to the "temple" and we made a big deal out of it.

I have also done this activity with a small group of Primary children during singing time, and they loved it. (Inside the temple they learned what song we were going to sing next.)
