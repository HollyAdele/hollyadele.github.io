I have entered a golden phase of Lego building.  My mom brought my old Legos, and now we have quite the collection.  Bryan is happy.  I've never seen him happy about acquiring Things before.

My method before was to snap random pieces together and then see what it looked like and then add a few pieces to increase the similarity.  Bryan built by deciding what to make, then finding pieces that would help him do that.  He built awesome things.

So I started doing that, and here's what I made.

Here's the Very Hungry Caterpillar, complete with the light of the moon, the little egg on a leaf, fruit for every day, each bite he took on Saturday, down to the slice of salami, and then finally the beautiful butterfly.  The kids loved it.

Here's a car, which helped me with a preposition lesson. I made it without instructions!
