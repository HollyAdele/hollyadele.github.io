When my friends and I build up a critical mass of broken electronics, we get together and take them apart. It's great because one of my friends is an engineer on the Air Force base and another is a thermodynamics professor at University of Dayton. 

Since it's broken, we don't mind breaking it further to open it. We also don't put it back together (we recycle it downtown). This allows children to participate and gain mechanical skill. 

My children have all handled processors and speaker magnets and wires. Sometimes we put them together again to make a time machine. 

If you have broken electronics I will gladly take them!
