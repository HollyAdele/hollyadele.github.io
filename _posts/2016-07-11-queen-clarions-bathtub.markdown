When Heidi pretends we are all fairies (and sparrow-men, boy fairies), I am Queen Clarion.  It's quite the compliment.

The other day Heidi built a bathtub for (me) Queen Clarion, complete with water bricks and faucet.

You might think that's Elsa.  It used to be, back when Princesses were in. But Heidi chose Elsa to be Queen Clarion.  Another compliment. :)
