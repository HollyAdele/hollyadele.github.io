Here's a family history activity to do with your children. 

Log into [FamilySearch.org](https://www.familysearch.org/en/) and find people these sentences describe. Each name can only be used once, and they have to be related to you. (Maybe break up this list over several sessions.) You get a point for each name you write, and the person with the most points after 30 minutes wins. Or this can be a family effort, and see how many the family can find together.
