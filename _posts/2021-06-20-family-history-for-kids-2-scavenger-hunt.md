title: Family History Scavenger Hunt for Kids
date: 2021-06-20
---

This activity is great for getting kids familiar with the Family Search website. They need to navigate around and use all the features, but there's no pressure. 

Well, a little bit of pressure, since we allotted only 30 minutes, but not the pressure of the eternal salvation of your progenitors. You don't feel your ancestors suffering in Spirit Prison as you fumble in the dark with illegible records, the way you might while actually looking for their records you can't find.

Log into FamilySearch.org and find people these sentences describe. Each name can only be used once, and they have to be related to you. We worked together as a team (and found 16 names in 30 minutes) because my children get stressed when their progress is measured against one of their sibling's. I put this list in a Google Doc and shared it with all the players. When a person started looking for a name, they put their own name as a signal to other players.   

Some of them are harder than others.
