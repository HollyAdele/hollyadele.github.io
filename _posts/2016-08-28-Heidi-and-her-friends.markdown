Heidi again.

My friends are Malia, Pennie, Maddy, Krystalle, Chloe, and Rosie. Krystalle loves ballerinas. Pennie likes to be the queen in our games.  Maddy has sixteen Barbies!  I have fairy Barbies.  Barbies are little dolls that have beautiful clothes and matching shoes.  They sometimes have a hairstyle and jewelry.

I've been learning about Science.  I even have my own science workbook.  I like to do things in it. I already did two science experiments!  One is put oil on your hands, then put water droplets on them.  The other was to make ice with yarn stuck in it.
