title: Free Schooling

If I had to describe my home school philosophy in two words, it would be Free Schooling. Children are free to choose what they learn (from a list of available options I have already curated). And the list of available options is heavily influenced by what is free in our community.

It's the twenty first century; there are so many free educational resources on the internet. I'm really excited about expanding electricity, internet connectivity, and Chromebooks to underserved communities because I think you can get a really great education online for free.  

Here is the list I let them choose from.

They're allowed to do this pretty much any time except after dinner (because I think they would be sad about stopping to go to bed) and on Sundays (because I want to reserve Sundays for church, gospel learning, and family history).  In the mornings they have to do five things before starting: Eat breakfast, get dressed, read scriptures, practice piano, and go for a walk or run.
