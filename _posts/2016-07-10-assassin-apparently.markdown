One day during dinner, a weird bug landed on our window.  And started doing something very strange.

The orange bug molted out of the black exoskeleton.  I was amazed at how much bigger the orange bug was. I bet he felt better. 

We had Heidi go get her magnifying glass (thanks goes to our late Grandpa Sorensen).

I found a [bug identifying website](http://www.insectidentification.org/pictureviewer/insects-gallery.asp?identification=Assassin-Bug), which helped me figure out it was called an Assassin Bug!  An assassin bug was on our window!  I went out to take pictures of it! Apparently their bite is painful to humans.  Yikes.

Ugh.  I'm all itchy now.
