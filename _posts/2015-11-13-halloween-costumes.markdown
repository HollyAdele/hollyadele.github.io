I biffed it this year.  I didn't want to spend the money on a store bought
costume, because I thought I could save money by DIYing it. So I had one evening
to get everything I needed.  I ran to JoAnn's and Walmart and grabbed everything
I thought I needed without thinking too much or calculating dollars per yard...

Yeah.  I spent two or three times more than even complete store bought costumes.
And it did not turn out two or three times as cute. I mean, my kids are super
adorable, and Heidi likes her princess braid, but... yeah.  They're just a few accessories
over Sunday clothes.

I will be making different Halloween costume building choices next year.

But here we are.  Heidi is a princess (sometimes she pretended to be Elsa, sometimes
  Rapunzel...), Peter is a prince (unlike most days when they pretend he's Anna
  and he insists he's the sister), and Austin is the dragon.  I was going for Queen.
  Heidi calls me the queen. "Good night, Queen."  It's the best. Anyway, we were
  at the mall for an event, and so I stashed the headband in my pocket and the scarf
  could pass as normal clothes.  Just in case the other parents' weren't dressed
  up, I wouldn't look like a doofus.
