Kids should see you reading, writing, drawing, painting, being curious, accepting feedback, exercising, building, and making. You can force a child to complete exercises, but you won't raise a lifelong learner unless you show that it's enjoyable and worth the cost (in money, time, and lost shows). Actions speak much louder than words. Children are always watching parents. 

In order to help them over writing hurdles, to explain a math concept, to give an overview of a topic on a whiteboard, you need to know the thing first. You need to do it with them. 

And that's good! Learning is so fun!  You never know when it will bless your life.
