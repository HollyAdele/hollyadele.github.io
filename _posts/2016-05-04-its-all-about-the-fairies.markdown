The reading-talent fairy. Yes, she's reading a fairy book.

Heidi is pretending to paint.  That's a cup full of blue duplos to rinse her dry brush in.

Heidi has some [magic clip](http://www.amazon.com/Disney-Princess-Kingdom-Magiclip-Giftset/dp/B009F7OUQE) Disney princesses.  Except that princesses are out and fairies are in, so she was asking for fairy dresses.  To her credit, she asked that I make them longer than in the picture. This used to be Cinderella, a green infant onesie and some yarn and several hours of my life.
