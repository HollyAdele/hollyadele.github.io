A little while ago we had Art Week.  Unfortunately it happened the same week our water heater sprung a huge leak and soaked everything downstairs (except our food storage, which was right by the water heater.  It was sitting on carpet that had no carpet padding, so water went around it.  Thank you Woodman Park, for cutting corners on maintaining my apartment, which is the first time I've said that).

And the same week I started feeling extremely tired due to my pregnancy.  Which I blamed on exhaustion and stress from the water heater. 

So we didn't do much in Art Week.

But we did paint with Acrylics.
