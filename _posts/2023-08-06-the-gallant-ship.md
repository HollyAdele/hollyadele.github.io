William W Phelps [wrote a song](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/collection-of-sacred-hymns-1835/66) about leaving on a ship on the Lord's errand. It was included in Emma's hymn book but not in subsequent editions. The Nauvoo Performing Missionaries did such a beautiful job singing it, I fell in love with the song. There is one version online by [Rachel Mecham Goats](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/bc/content/shared/content/english/pdf/music/submitted/phelps_the_gallant_ship_eng.pdf) that sounds so great but is written for advanced singers. My family was asked to sing something for Pioneer Day and I wanted to sing The Gallant Ship, but it was a little much for a four year old (and let's be honest, for me). So I wrote up a very simple version for our very beginner little voices. It took me seven hours and now I know how to use Musescore. 

Enjoy!
