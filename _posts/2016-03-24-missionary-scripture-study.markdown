I love scripture study.

Being a grown-up, church isn't about learning, for me, anymore. I am super distracted because I have small children who depend on me for reverence in Sacrament Meeting.  There's a good chance that I am teaching in the other hours, and while learning new things from the Spirit as you say them is a thing, it's not a good idea to depend on it for spiritual sustenance. Therefore, personal scripture study is essential.

I don't do enough scripture study. That has been the message from the Spirit the last few weeks.  And I want to solve that problem before General Conference, because I don't want that to be the only message I receive.

I am jealous of missionaries because they have two hours of scripture study built into their day. Doesn't that sound heavenly?

Of course, I am in charge of my day.  I choose what I do.  I am choosing to not study my scriptures.  I feel bad about that. I know busier people than me fit in way more scripture study than me.

I've been trying to write out my obstacles and why I haven't been studying, and the excuses just sound so lame.

I know that the blessings will outweigh the cost.  I know that the time will pay for itself in increased vision and happiness. I feel the Spirit right now as I write this, giving me confidence.

What has worked for me in the past:

  - Not sleeping until I have read enough to feel inspired.

  - Coloring lines of favorite verses with colored pencils.

  - Keeping scriptures next to my bed and reading as soon as I wake up, but before I feel like getting up.

  - Thinking about problems while reading the scriptures

  - Thoroughly preparing for talks and lessons
