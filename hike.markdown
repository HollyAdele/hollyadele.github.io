Welcome to our City Hike! I'm so happy you're here. Don't forget to find me and say hello. And be sure to meet a few new people tonight. If you don't have anything to talk about, talk about them. Everybody loves to talk about themselves. Ask questions and be truly interested in the answers. When they go home, they'll say, "That girl's great.  There's just something about her that I like."

Can you help us start on time?  We really want to start hiking at 7:15. Nag me if you see it's getting close.

Be safe!  Don't let any geese poop on you.

Grab a water bottle and a trash bag in case you find some trash on the way. Head north on Jefferson.

Obey the light to cross Monument, and go between those bushes.

 First, Second, and Third Years: keep walking past these fountains. Fourth Years gather here for First-aid certification. Listen to your YCLs because they love you and they want you to learn things that can save lives.  When the YCLs finish, start hiking again and gather the other years when they are done.

Go down the stairs (or go down the ramp to the left if you are on wheels).

First Years gather on the bottom step for your certification.  These are my children!  Heidi, Peter, and Austin.

Second Years gather under the Five Rivers Pavillion.

Third Years, your spot is a bit farther. Pass the flood markers.

Up for a scavenger hunt? Keep your eyes open for these:

* Zorro's mark

* A fisherman

* Wildlife besides a goose, a duck, and a seagull

* A lonely basketball court

* A Jewish temple

* Goose poop (This one should be really difficult. No goose would ever poop on sidewalk.)

* And Sister Braun (You have to tell me your name and give me a hug to check this one off.)

Follow that path up to the right and cross the pedestrian bridge. My daughter Heidi is showing you the way.  By the way, she's five and she finished this whole hike.  So you totally can too.

Then cross the bridge.

Third Years, you made it to your meeting spot!

When the fourth years come to get you, follow that biker down the path toward the underpass.

You should probably avoid this precarious rockpile of death.

And these poky plants (that's what Heidi called them, not me.)

Go under here. This is I-75.

Look!  Some trees tripped going over the dam.

Cross the street, then continue to the left on the other side. It was super busy when I tried to cross.  Don't cross when a car is coming, and don't all cross at once like a herd of cows.  Look both ways, think for yourself, and don't just follow your friends.  Sorry, my children are very small and so I'm stuck in the habit of saying stuff like that.

Heidi loves fairies right now, so she was pretty sure this is Mermaid Lagoon.  Keep your eyes open for one and let me know if you catch a glimpse.

Turn right to go into Island Metropark.  You made it!
![the path to go to Island Metropark](/post-images/hike/turn-right-to-go-to-island-metropark.jpg)


A Young Woman leader should be waiting here with snacks.  Code word: cookie monster.  Don't take snacks from someone who doesn't know the code word. And try to wait until everyone has gotten one before taking a second.
![benches and pavillion](/post-images/hike/grab-snacks-here.jpg)


Say goodbye to your new friends and to the Young Women leader who stopped at the meeting spot with your year. Find me, give me a hug, then your parents should be waiting for you in this parking lot at 8:30.

Your Young Women leaders are still parked at the Dayton First Ward Building, so ask your parents to please give them a ride back to their cars.

See you at camp!
