Welcome to our City Hike! I'm so happy you're here. Be sure to meet a few new people tonight. If you don't have anything to talk about, talk about them. Everybody loves to talk about themselves. Ask questions and be truly interested in the answers. When they go home, they'll say, "That girl's great.  There's just something about her that I like."

Can you help us start on time?  We really want to start hiking at 7:15. Nag me if you see it's getting close.

Be safe!  Don't let any geese poop on you.

Grab a water bottle and head north on Jefferson.

Obey the light to cross Monument, and go between those bushes.

 First, Second, and Third Years: keep walking past these fountains. Fourth Years gather here for First-aid certification. Listen to your YCLs because they love you and they want you to learn things that can save lives.  When the YCLs finish, start hiking again and gather the other years when they are done.

Go down the stairs (or go down the ramp to the left if you are on wheels).

First Years gather on the bottom step for your certification.  These are my children!  Heidi, Peter, and Austin.

Second Years gather under the Five Rivers Pavillion.

Third Years, your spot is a bit farther. Pass the flood markers.

Follow that path up to the right and cross the pedestrian bridge. My daughter Heidi is showing you the way.  By the way, she's five and she finished this whole hike.  So you totally can too.

Then cross the bridge.

Third Years, you made it to your meeting spot!

A Young Woman leader should be waiting nearby with snacks.  Code word: cookie monster.  Don't take snacks from someone who doesn't know the code word. And try to wait until everyone has gotten one before taking a second.

Stay with your year and when everyone is ready, head back to the Dayton Ward building to find your ride.  If you'd like to, grab a plastic bag for any trash you see.  Because daughters of God bring order and beauty wherever they go, and because Christ is all about cleaning up messes he didn't make.

When you get back to the building, be sure to tell your year leader when you leave so they won't worry.  Leaders are really good at worrying.

Thanks for coming, and see you at camp!
