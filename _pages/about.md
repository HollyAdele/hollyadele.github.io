I was born in Colorado and attended Brigham Young University for college. I majored
in elementary education, and now I teach five students, my Heidi, my Peter, my Austin, my Erika, and my Bethany.

I'm married to a web developer and we live in the Mid-West.

When I have a few spare moments, I love to study.
