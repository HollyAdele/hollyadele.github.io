I taught Relief Society today, and this is what kind of what I said.  

It is in our best interest to make covenants, because we get back much more in blessings than we give in obedience.  

So there is a difference between covenants and contracts.  In contracts it is very clear what is expected of each party, and if each line item is not fulfilled, the contract is broken and is not required to be kept by the other party. In covenant relationships, the parties do all that they can for the other, and they forgive each other.  They do not keep track of offenses; they forget wrongdoings.  They don't have [calculator marriages](https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/brent-d-slife_experience-love-limitations-psychological-explanation/).

Consider the parable of the prodigal son.  The son spent his inheritance on riotous living and had zero reason to expect anything upon his return.  But his father was operating under a covenant relationship: the father welcomed the son with open arms and a feast. [Luke 15: 11-32](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/15.11-32) I know that this is what fathers do for sons, and I know this is what our Heavenly Father will do for his children.  Grace makes up the difference in our covenant relationships.

"The Lord will bring about his covenants and his gospel to the house of Israel. Wherefore, he will bring them again out of captivity." [1 Nephi 22:11-12](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/22.11-12)

This was also the Old Testament prophet Hosea's story.  The Lord told him to do something a little crazy.  Something that we strongly counsel our young people not to do. Hosea is commanded to marry a harlot. And, surprise, she leaves him for her lovers. And yet Hosea takes her back. [Hosea 1-2](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/hosea/1?lang=eng)  Hosea was operating under a covenant relationship too. [Matthew 19:9](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/19.9?lang=eng) suggests that a spouse is not required to do this, but Hosea did anyway, to teach the House of Israel how God will treat them: "And in that day I will make a covenant for them...and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my people, 'Thou art my people,' and they shall say, 'Thou art my God.'" [Hosea 2:23](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/hosea/2.23?lang=eng)

The Lord often uses family relationships to teach about covenants: [Mosiah 5:7](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.7), [Doctrine and Covenants 45:3-5](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.3-5), [Moses 6:59](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.59), [1 Nephi 21:14](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/21.14-16).

The Lord promised to be Moses' God before Moses led the Exodus.  "And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians." [Exodus 6:7](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ex/6.7?lang=eng#6)

The children of Israel looked back on that promise through the years. Nephi encouraged his brothers, "Let us be strong, like unto Moses... the Lord is able to deliver us, even as our fathers." [1 Nephi 4:2](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4.12?lang=eng)

And this experience was used again, when the Lord was teaching Oliver Cowdery a feature of his covenant: "I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost... this is the spirit of revelation and the spirit by which Moses brought the children of Israel through the Red Sea on dry ground." [Doctrine and Covenants 8:2-3](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/8.2-3?lang=eng) 

The Lord delivers His covenant people.  "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised." [Luke 4:18](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/4.18)
