One time when I was playing at the play place, my mom said we should leave so we could play at a new place in the mall. I didn't want to go until I noticed it was REALLY fun.

When I walked in, I thought it was kind of like a movie theater. But when I went in, then there were miniature shops! And cars that go when you move the steering wheel. The cars weren't too complicated!

We had so much fun with them.

One of the shops was a supermarket.

I loved that one. We set up lots of toy food on shelves and then we sold it to kids!

Here is the pickle barrel.

And the shopping cart.

Another one was a bakery.

I got so much toy money with it! People liked to come in and buy the stuff that I pretended to make. There were toys already in the shape of bread and I just pretended to whisk with a toy whisk in a toy mixing bowl, then I poured out the batter onto a silicone mat. Then we put the batter in the oven.

And then we sold the bread. There was a big menu on top of the kitchen sink! We used that to know what to charge customers. But there was no baguette price on the menu! So we just said those cost five dollars.

There was also a hospital.

It was no fun because I didn't get any money for it. There was a giant wooden Operation game built on the table.

I didn't like it. It was too gross. (Mom thought it was awesome because it had a real blood pressure cuff and anatomy chart and toy thermometers and stethoscopes.)

There was a barber shop that I LOVED!

It was so cool. There were toy styling supplies like a comb, a mirror, a hair dryer, a blush brush, and scissors (with no blades so you could pretend to cut hair.)

There were some pictures of hairstyles on the wall, a table (with a mail slot behind it). There was a little barber's chair, just right for me.

There was even a little uniform.

There were lots of little uniforms.

One time we put Peter in jail, and he escaped! Kohana and I had to chase him around the shops, through the alleys!

There was a little mail box.

It had a door in front. You open it up and drop the toy letters inside. They slid down and made a pile at the bottom of the box. Then a kid pretending to be the mailman picks them up and distributes them randomly to all the shops. Each shop had a mail slot. We even gave some to the jail which was the back of the store.
