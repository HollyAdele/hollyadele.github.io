title: 100 Things I Learned from My Education Degree
---
1.	Content Knowledge
a.	Concept Statement: Define your concepts concisely.  Understand your subject completely and plan your definitions.  Write in your lesson plan what you will say.  It’s harder to teach coherently than you think it will be, and you won’t get it on your first try.  Make your first try NOT in front of the class.  I know you learned this content in elementary school yourself, but it takes some time to come back and it won’t come back and out intelligently while people are staring at you.
b.	Utility: Summarize and review.  People only remember things they use often.  Teach things that they actually will use often and teach processes that will make the most common problems easier.
c.	Best Practices: Think big picture and teach the subject the best way it can be learned.  Activities should follow the discipline and should have a point besides cute.   They should be self-directed and real.
i.	Social Studies
1.	Stories about People
2.	Archaeology, Geography, Humanities, Political Science, Psychology
3.	(((((((Self) family) community) Expanded community) US and government) World) Ancient Civilizations)
4.	Culture is how groups of people have decided how to meet basic human needs. It includes:
a.	History, Economy, Family practices, People, Government, Norms and expectations, Thinking, beliefs, Clothing, Occupations, Education, Music, Geography, Religion, Sports, Food, Entertainment, Theater, Hobbies
ii.	Math
1.	Teaching
a.	People DO math.  They don’t KNOW math.  They think, organize, talk, look for patterns, and create.  Why do we just memorize and practice?  Your teaching should include problem solving, communication, reasoning and proof, representations, connections.
b.	Give all enough time to think.  Faster kids can check their answers, think of good ways to explain it to someone who doesn’t understand. Speed of thought is not intelligence and it really is not worth. Pencil on left side: still thinking and working. Pencil on the right side: I have one answer but I am still thinking and working on other possibilities.
c.	Don’t learn shortcuts until you learn the long cuts!  If a kid is doing something the long way, let them.  Sometimes it is all they are ready for.  Increase the numbers until the long way is too cumbersome.  Then say, “is this working for you?”  If they say no, you can teach them the short way.
d.	When a kid gets a problem wrong, have them find the mistake.  Give them a hint, but let them do the thinking.
e.	Orchestrating discussions
i.	Anticipate student responses
ii.	Monitor students
iii.	Select particular students
iv.	Sequence responses
v.	Connect ideas
vi.	Don’t cut corners on discussion
f.	What should other students be doing while one student is presenting?  Teach each one and then have them practice each one, during regular lessons.
i.	Describe: retell first child’s answer
ii.	Compare: first child’s answer to yours
iii.	Question: think of questions you could ask them
iv.	Evaluate: ask yourself if you agree or disagree and why.
g.	Show problem in five ways
i.	Manipulatives
ii.	Picture
iii.	Language
iv.	Symbols
v.	Real world context
h.	You must have flexible understanding of the concepts you teach.  You should teach to flexible understanding too.  It hurts.  Too bad.
2.	Content
a.	Multiplication
i.	Grouping language:
1.	3x2 can be read as 3 groups of 2.
2.	3x2x4 can be read as 3 groups of 2 groups of 4.
3.	4x2x3 gives the same answer, but different picture: 4 groups of 2 groups of 3.
4.	12/2 can be read as put 12 pieces into groups of 2 or put 12 pieces into 2 groups.
ii.	Factor language
1.	If x is a factor of y, then the number y can be arranged in an array with x as the dimension of one of the sides. Also, you can make x groups of equal size, with none left over, with a total of y objects altogether.  Or, there are x objects in a while number of groups, with y objects altogether.
b.	Division
i.	Partitive is when you know how many piles there are but you don’t know how many are in each pile.
ii.	Measurement is when you know how many are in each pile but you don’t know how many piles there are.
iii.	Factors: To find the factors of a number, arrange that many cubes into a rectangle.  The sides are the factors.  For 12, you can make a rectangle 3x4 or 4x3 or 2x6 or 6x2 or 12x1 or 1x12.  Those are all the factors.
iv.	Divisibility Rules
1.	0: none are divisible by 0
2.	1: all are
3.	2: last digit is even
4.	3: add up all the digits, is the sum divisible by 3?
5.	4: last two digits is divisible by 4
6.	5 ends in 5 or 0
7.	9: add up all digits, is the sum divisible by 9?
8.	10: ends in 0
v.	Russian peasant method of division: Write the problem down, create one column under each multiplier.  The numbers on the left side are repeatedly halved, the numbers on the right side are repeatedly doubled.  When an odd number is halved, any fractional part is dropped.  This continues until the entry in the left column is one.  Then, strike out any rows with even numbers in the left hand column, and add the entries that are in the right hand column.
c.	Other bases are fun.
d.	Lattice math is fun.
e.	Probability is fun.
iii.	Literacy
1.	3 hours of literature
a.	First hour
i.	20 min SSR
ii.	20 min journal (SSW)
iii.	20 min read aloud
b.	Second hour
i.	30 min shared writing and guided writing
ii.	20 min writing lesson
iii.	10 min sharing journals
c.	Third hour
i.	30 min guided leveled reading
ii.	20 min reading lesson or shared reading
iii.	10 min sharing (book talks)
2.	Reading
a.	The Grand Release of Responsibility: Read alouds to guided reading (with varying levels of guidance) to SSR (silent sustained reading or self selected reading)
i.	Shared reading: read text first for enjoyment.  Then go back and look at objectives tied to the core. Then assess.  Or, Pre-reading, reading, response, exploring or application. All have access to the text and the lead reader is fluent. Read for comprehension.
1.	Tools
a.	Magnifying glass to reveal only one word or bring attention to only one element
b.	Pointer is a thin pencil-thickness dowel with an eraser on the end
c.	Laminate the book, then you can write on it
d.	Use sticky notes to cover letters, then peel them off one at a time to guess the word, model what the brain does when it reads. Or write down “so what” connections and “ah ha!” connections.
2.	Applications
a.	Advertising poster
b.	Letter to author
c.	Journal entry as character
d.	Rewrite ending
e.	Skit
f.	Enrichment of content
g.	Advice to main character
ii.	Choral reading: Echo reading: leader reads a line, everyone repeats same line. Leader and chorus reading: leader reads the main part, group reads the refrain. Small group reading: class divides into groups, each group reads a part. Alternate lines: one group speaks alternately with another. Cumulative reading: one student or group starts, others join in one by one. One word at a time. Combine selections. Read as a round
iii.	Guided reading
1.	Lesson plan of group meeting
a.	Kids are in heterogeneous groups, teacher pulls homogeneous group of kids out.
b.	Whisper read passage already read. Do running records on them, have one read a little louder.
i.	Running records
c.	Introduce book. Picture walk, open up schema, build background.
d.	Stagger start, mumble read. Do running records according to a schedule.
e.	Phonics or comprehension lesson.
2.	Organization of class: Introduce 5 books, have them write their top 3 choices, then don’t even look at their choices. Walk around with a book, give them five finger test. Miss five words on one page, it’s too hard. Read one book together every once in a while when kids start thinking they are in the dumb group.
b.	Teaching phonics
i.	Inductive: figure out generalizations
ii.	Choose words carefully.  They should be alike enough to show the concept, but they should not be too narrow and give the kids the wrong idea.
iii.	Read words together.  What do you see?  What do you hear?
iv.	State the generalization.
v.	Students come up with examples and non-examples
vi.	Practice
vii.	Teach common words that don’t follow patterns as sight words
viii.	Word sorts
c.	Teaching fluency
i.	Modeling: Teacher reading, Choral reading, Tapes
ii.	Repetition: shared reading, repeated reading, familiar and unfamiliar texts, preparation for sharing
iii.	Instruction and guidance: paired reading, direct assistance, chunking activity (write phrasing marks in)
iv.	Other support: predictable books, lots of silent reading, easy books, shared reading at home,
v.	Fluency is linked to comprehension: kids read less if they have low fluency and slow readers notice they take longer
vi.	Speed: >100 words per minute at a grade level text.  Accuracy: 99-100% correct, self-correction,
vii.	Sound of language: phrasing, intonation, expression
d.	Kids struggle with reading because
i.	Inadequate sight word vocabulary. So build vocabulary before reading text
1.	Which words are important to understand the story
2.	How much prior knowledge do they nee
3.	Is the word encountered frequently
4.	Does the word have multiple meanings
5.	Does the content require pre-teaching?  Kids forget stuff, don’t assume they know
6.	Which words can be figured out from the context?
ii.	Weak decoding skills
iii.	Over reliance on phonics
iv.	Don’t see chunks or patterns
v.	Help by providing appropriate reading materials. One they select, one you select.
3.	Writing
a.	The Grand Release of Responsibility: Language Experience approach, or guided writing, to peer editing and writers conferences to journaling
i.	Language Experience Approach is where kid says something, teacher writes it down, gives it to kid to do activities with.  Read at home, copy it over to a book, read to class, make word strips, draw pictures, etc.
ii.	Interactive writing is where you practice above, perfect below.  All have white boards and markers and erasers.
1.	Dictation: what we say we can write, what we write we can read, what we write we can change
2.	Focus on print: w-w-w what letter?  How do we leave a space?  Is it capital?
3.	Focus on spelling
4.	Revise: teacher creates rough draft, students edit and create a final copy
5.	Publish
iii.	Journaling
1.	Topic generation:
a.	Things I am excited about
b.	Things I am worried about
c.	Places I would like to go to
d.	People who have influenced me
iv.	Writing groups: kids organized heterogeneously, give feedback. Hearts and Wishes.
v.	Revision
1.	Content before mechanics
2.	Then audience
3.	Unique ideas
4.	Titles
5.	Honest voice
6.	Organization
7.	Rich details
8.	Sentences
9.	Let the kid make the changes at his own level. Involve him with questions, assess needed lessons. Be patient: we don’t get angry at a seed for not being a flower. Conferencing is better than marking up a paper because you’ll be nicer, you’ll understand them better, and you can raise or lower the anxiety level. Focus on the writer.
b.	Model writing
i.	Morning message
ii.	Personal notes
iii.	Share own writing
iv.	Think alouds
c.	Teach spelling and handwriting because the public judges harshly on those criteria. Teach them together.
i.	Look at word
ii.	Say it to yourself
iii.	Say each letter to yourself
iv.	Close your eyes and spell it to yourself
v.	Write the word and check that it is spelled correctly
vi.	Write the word again and check again
vii.	If students misses 0 on the pre-test, don’t make them take the post-test. If they miss 3 words, they have 3 words on their test.
viii.	Handwriting
1.	Slant
2.	Spacing
3.	Alignment
4.	Letter form and size
5.	Line quality
4.	Have a word-rich environment
a.	Word wall, labeled everything
b.	Games: rhyming, segmenting
iv.	Science
1.	5E Inquiry model
a.	Engage. Short activity that introduces the concept and hooks curiosity. Pose the inquiry question. 5-7 minutes, short and sweet.
b.	Explore. Students explore the concept using the inquiry question. Teacher is circulating, eavesdropping, and redirecting.
c.	Explain. Help the students construct the lesson’s concept.  This is the “teaching” part.  First, students share.  They justify conclusions with data.  Then, reteach any concepts that were unclear.  Nail the concept.
d.	Elaborate. Apply gained knowledge in a new activity.  No new concepts, just the same one extended a little farther.  Areas you could go: science in personal and social perspectives, science and technology, science as inquiry, history and nature of science.
e.	Evaluate. You really should be doing this the whole time, but also have a summative evaluation at the end.
d.	Sticky Platform: Obey the principles of the sticky platform.  The brain keeps information that is linked to other information.  Open the students’ background knowledge.  Tie the new content specifically and explicitly to the previous lesson, to other subjects, to the students, to their culture, to your culture, to history, to popular media, to literature, to other languages, to everything they know. Children do not think in subject areas.
e.	Questions: Focus on what the students want to learn.  Answer questions.  You can also create questions in the students’ minds.  The best learning is inquiry learning. Don’t shoot a kid down when they ask a question.  Do you really want them to not ask questions? The teacher is the mentor, facilitator, and guide.  The student is the teacher. Open ended questions and longer wait times. Defending thinking leads to higher-level thinking.
i.	Metacognition
1.	“Do you see why._____?” They have to think about their thinking to answer.
2.	When you have kids do mental math and you have them keep track of their mental math, that’s metacognition.
2.	 Learning and Development
a.	Support development.  If a kid writes something, have them edit it and make it better.  Encourage them to add more to a picture.  Teach them the next step in math or push them to higher numbers.  Take the extra step to research something further, even if it is a pain.  Have them try a few more times at physical tasks.  Push them to think a little more clearly and deeply than they do the first time, than they want to, than they can right now.  (Fear and the critical moment: the next step is outside their current abilities.  So help them and encourage them, and in that moment they grow.)  Teach them how to stay organized and give them ample time to organize.
b.	Whole Child: Think about intellectual, social, physical, emotional, spiritual domains.  They need to develop all of themselves.  The more resources they have in themselves, the more independent and empowered they will be.
c.	Behold Your Little Ones: Remember you are teaching people.  Be concerned about what they want to learn, teach in ways that will work for them, let them work with peers, make lessons relevant to them, give them choices and honor those choices, interact with them, meet their needs. Make it their lesson. Show them why they want to know what you are going to teach.
d.	How people learn:
i.	Not sequential: stumble on a new idea and incorporate it into a schema. Easy: assimilate related info or Hard: accommodate unrelated info.
ii.	Not isolated or in competition but in collaboration.
iii.	Active and engaged learners, teachers create experiences and opportunities.
iv.	Readers create their own meaning, they don’t figure out the author’s meaning.
v.	When scaffolded, they can learn more
vi.	Use strategies to understand
vii.	When they read and write; no substitutes for those
viii.	When they are motivated
3.	Diverse Learners- Different people learn best under different circumstances.  You can help them learn by adapting your teaching.
a.	Culture and Language
i.	Students who are learning the language and the content simultaneously are obviously going to struggle more than students simply learning content.
ii.	Don’t give tests that test language and not content.
iii.	Create a print rich classroom
iv.	Write key points on the board
v.	Teach essential vocabulary before lesson and reading
vi.	Connect to background
vii.	The achievement gap is really the opportunity gap.
1.	High expectations + continuous support + PLC = characteristics of high achieving low-income schools.
viii.	MULTICULTURAL EDUCATION

i.	Questioning.
1.	Give think time. Ask for elaboration.  Survey the class.  Describe how they arrived at their answer.
2.	Ask a question, then, “Think, I’m going to come around and you can whisper me your answer.”
3.	Divergent questions.  You can’t push a kid who doesn’t know the answer to answer a convergent question.  You can get them to answer a divergent one, though.
4.	Convergent questions should be quick and only at the beginning.
5.	Use all of Bloom’s
a.	Knowledge- remember who, what, where, when, how, describe
b.	Comprehension- retell, organize a collection of facts
c.	Application- Use facts, rules, principles.
d.	Analysis- separate whole into component parts
e.	Synthesis- combine ideas to form a new whole
f.	Evaluation- development of opinions, judgments, decisions
6.	Inquiry. You always have an umbrella.  Is it teacher centered or is it child centered.
a.	Science
i.	Conceptual change:
ii.	Commit to an outcome.  Learners become aware of their perceptions by thinking about it, making written predictions, explaining their reasons (committing to an outcome) before the activity begins.
iii.	Expose beliefs.  Share predictions and explanations.
iv.	Confront beliefs. Hands-on testing, then discussing what they learned in small groups.
v.	Accommodate the concept.  Learners resolve conflicts between initial ideas and their observations.
vi.	Extend the concept.  Learners try to make connections between what they learned in class and other situations.
vii.	Go beyond.  Learners identify and pursue additional questions and problems.
b.	Social Studies
i.	Powerpoint. Begin with a question, generate hypotheses, look at data (quotes, maps, etc.)
c.	Math
i.	Develop
1.	Launch. Pose a task with a clear purpose but many possible paths.  Aligned with state core. Activate background knowledge.
2.	Explore. Students develop ideas, strategies, multiple representations. Group students intentionally (maybe  homogeneously). Ask students questions that will engage students in the task, prompt or guide exploration, clarify mathematical thinking, deepen student thinking.  Select 3-5 strategies, order them by complexity.
3.	Discuss. Bring students forward to describe their thinking.
ii.	Solidify
1.	Launch. Pose a string of related tasks, one at a time and have them use a specific strategy.  Confirm, connect, generalize, or transfer mathematical understanding.
2.	Explore. Group them intentionally. Ask questions to prompt, clarify, guide, scaffold, probe, connect, refocus. Decide who you want to present.
3.	Discuss. Students describe mathematical thinking.
iii.	Practice
1.	Launch. Open background knowledge.
2.	Explore. Walk around, observe.
3.	Discuss with individuals or groups.

ii.	Modeling- to/with/by
iii.	Examples and non-examples
iv.	Think/Pair share
v.	Work in ones, twos, groups
vi.	Active student engagement
vii.	Role playing
b.	Others: Choral response.  Some people learn only when they hear themselves say it. Student demo, changing roles (teacher is student, student is teacher), CLASS DISCUSSION
c.	Promote critical thinking
i.	Compare, contrast, justify, defend, debate, analyze, synthesize, categorize, interpret, predict, evaluate, cause and effect, brainstorming, teachers asks how, why, when, tell more.
ii.	If we teach higher-order thinking, the kids will do well on the test AND they will be entirely educated.  We don’t have to drill and kill
d.	(Skill (Attitude (Principle (Concept (Fact)))))
e.	Remembering information:
i.	Easy to forget
1.	Bad organization
2.	Weak connections
3.	Interference, confusion, didn’t use knowledge
ii.	Easy to remember
1.	Familiarity
2.	Organized
3.	Practiced
f.	Use your resources!  Take the extra step to familiarize yourself with your school’s resources, your district’s resources, your community’s resources, parent resources, student resources, library resources, local college resources.  Ask for recommendations for online resources.  Your students’ experience will be way better.
g.	Allow your students to use technology.  Allow them to help you fix problems with class technology.  Technology is the way of the future and familiarity with technology is a huge advantage.
h.	Amy Miner’s
i.	Concept Formation
1.	Study 3-4 examples of something and summarize how they are alike. The ways they are alike are the critical attributes of the concept.  Then you can decide whether a new item is an example, distinguish examples from non-examples, produce examples, and correct examples.
2.	Variation 1: List, Group, Label.  List as many things as you can about the concept.  Examine your list to see if certain things seem to go together.  Think of labels for the groups.  One student can create a group and the others say what the common attribute is for.
3.	Variation 2: Concept Attainment. More teacher directed.  Teacher tells important attributes and gives a list of examples and non-examples which are missing one or more critical attribute.  Then give more examples or non-examples and let the children decide.  Then have children come up with their own examples.
ii.	Deliberation
1.	Takes a lot of time, but worth it because it uses a lot of democratic processes.
2.	Choose issues that are controversial but not traumatic.
3.	Send letter home, give background info, invite them to come participate.
4.	Teacher Role: Establish norms, be a moderator (time keeper), gather materials, provide background knowledge, choose topic, decompress situation.
5.	Student Role: Actively participate, ticket for participate, engage then disengage.
6.	How to decompress: move to take a stand (create a line, establish opposing viewpoints on each end, have kids stand where they feel they are), write a paper.
iii.	Seminar
1.	Read text.  “Stop! What does that mean?” Go get more information, ask questions, state opinions.
2.	Do this with a children’s book, film clip, news article, piece of art.
iv.	Debate
1.	Procon.org (free) list of 100 issues being debated.
2.	Choices ($25 for a unit, high school level)
3.	Messy, not fun, but memorable
5.	Management and Motivation
a.	Management
