Here are some notes I took after a blessing I got from my dad before I started my senior year:

>new avenues for me to understand
>understand and help my teachers
>opportunities to help people less fortunate than us
>Seek the Spirit and have him as my constant companion as should be.

And another blessing:

>I recommend that you study the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, our elder
>brother and exemplar, for His life shows us everything that we need to do.  
>The boys will be interesting, and will have the spirit of discernment that I
>need, so they can know how they apply to you (?)
>School will be better, because of my faith and the faith of my seminary friends
>My intellect will be vigorous
>Health, strength
>Discern what's important, so I can be sure that I'm accomplishing things
>Heavenly Father is pleased with me, loves me very much
>I will understand what is being taught in my classes
>Seminary teachers will love me


This is a note from Jon, a boy I went on some dates with. I met him at Staci's
young single adult activity.  He brought a friend to go on a double date with my roommate
and they ended up getting married.

>Hi this is Jon i just wanted to say thangs for going with of last night I had fun.  i hope to see you again.

Here's part of a chat with a boy we called Poogi.  He was a funny kid.

Here's possibly the only picture I have from high school:  My dad took me to a
baseball game.  A friend gave us their box tickets.  The same friend who fixed
my mom and dad's porch for free.

These are some cue sheets from when I was the lighting technician during some
shows.

Here are some notes Jake McMahon and I made after Mock Trial.  Just some things we learned.

>Male lawyers and witnesses need jackets.  
>Practice entering evidence.
>You need a pen.
>Be aware of the relevance of your lines of questioning.
>Anticipate objections, have a statement prepared.
>Eye contact is important and intimidating.
>Incorporate physical actions into speeches.  At least be aware of what you do: flipping hair, stance�
>How to say "affidavit"
>You are going to have to take your belt off to get into the courtroom.  
>Before court: provide a high stress test-situation.
>Somebody is going to have to introduce the team.
>Talk slower than you think.
>Everybody read the testimonies and evidences and get points out on their own.  
>It�s really annoying to do as a group.  
>Be the team to start the hand shaking.  Know which hand to shake with.
>You look awesome if you have rule numbers memorized and can paraphrase without
>reading it right there in court.
>Somebody is going to drop out, and someone else is going to have to fill that
>spot.  Expect the unexpected�
>After trial, when the judges are deciding, don�t pack up, don�t joke with each
>other, sit there in silence.  Even- especially- if the other team doesn�t.
>Stand anytime you talk to the court.
>Stand all the way up.
>Critique sometimes on acting only.  Your case is less important than your acting.
>Say "Your Honor" every time you address the court.
>Don't just show the exhibit, give it.
>Eat before trial.
>Where to sit: plaintiff by jury box.
>When the other team's attorneys give you something, make eye contact, take it
>from their hand, and say thank you.  Throws them off.
>You may or may not get water.
>Witnesses:  judges like cheesy emotion.  I don�t, but I�m not a judge.  
>All lawyers have an opinion about how you should act in court.  A different
>opinion.  They all think theirs to be correct.  They will try to make you act
>like they do in court.  It obviously works, but it�s not the only way.  
>The mics are on at all times.  No swearing.
>Take every available bathroom break.
>Security cameras are on at all times.
>If you want to know what time it is, wear a watch.  Don�t you dare even look
>back there.
>Watch when someone gives a speech.  Smile encouragingly at your team and stare
>down the other team.
>Know which hand to be sworn in with.
>Off team: keep track of objections.  Made by both teams, lost/won by both teams.  
>Need paper to take and pass notes.  To the team members in the bar.  No one else.  
>Witnesses: don't accept anything from anyone behind the bar.
>Be willing to make objections!  They may be overruled, but they are usually
>effective anyway.
>At the podium: stand on both feet.
>You may or may not be able to get help for objections.
>Don't whisper jokes, don't laugh about anything, don't smile at what looks like
>an inside joke.  The judge will think you are rude.
>Know the gender of your own witnesses, and be aware of the other team's.  It's
>just plain embarrassing to not.
>Speak loudly, with animation.  Entertain the judges.  
>Double space your questions and never go into a trial with pencil markings on
>them.  If you want to change anything, print out a new copy.
>Go over the rules long in advance.  Everybody has to understand them.  
>Ask to respond to objections before you do.  Always respond to the judge.  
>Confidence is more important that correctness in mock trial.
