Before my sophomore year, my dad gave me this blessing:

>Holly Adele Brison
By the authority of the Melchizedek priesthood and as your daddy I give you a fatherâ€™s blessing
As you prepare to go to school this fall semester
I bless you with a keen and active mind
And I bless you with good energy to undertake the things that  you want to do
Your desires are good
And the lord is highly pleased with you
I bless you that you will make many new friends
And you will soon meet a good man who will be worthy of you
Listen carefully to the inclinations of the holy ghost
Listen carefully to the general authorities in conference and at other times
To your teachers and your priesthood leaders
I bless you with health and strength
And I warn you against the typical dangers in this world
And my baby daughter I give you a special blessing
That you will somehow just be very lucky

 I met Bryan that semester.
