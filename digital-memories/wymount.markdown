Heidi’s Instruction Manual, written when my friends were babysitting Heidi while Bryan
and I were in the hospital during Peter's birth. My Relief Society President,
Andrea Tate, organized two hour babysitting shifts.

If you say no, never give it to her, even if she cries. “This isn’t for Heidi.”  “It’s not time for that right now.”
If she throws tantrums very often, let her rest in her crib with her pacifier and monkey.
She’ll never tell you her diaper is full.  You’ll probably smell soiled diapers, and you don’t need to change wet diapers until they’re pretty full.  She’ll protest a change.  Give her a toy to distract her.  If that doesn’t work, play peek-a-boo, kiss the feet, eat the toes, This Little Piggy, blow on the tummy… If that doesn’t work, put one leg over her and hold her down while you finish.
Signs:  pointing at her mouth = thirsty.  Pulling on her pointer finger = out.  Sometimes she’ll say “out” when she wants up or in, they are very similar.  Pretending to open her hands like a book (this one is difficult for her) = play with books.  Clapping = I’m hungry, I want that, or I want you to do something for me.  Twirling an “L”= Play with me.  ‘Play’ actually is twirling a thumb and a pinkie, we’ll still working on that.  Rubbing tummy = please give me that or please do something for me.  One finger pointing to middle of other palm = Jesus (she gets this one confused with others.)  Folding her arms = I want to pray.  Just say a short little prayer, asking or thanking God for one thing.  Trying to stick one hand into the other fist = in or up, or I’m hungry and want to get in my high chair.

>Favorite toys:  balls, piano, magnetic letters, photo albums under the couch.  “I love you, Through and Through.”  “I Love You, Every Little Bit.”  “Old Mac Donald Had a Farm”  “On the Day You Were Born.” (with that one, if she points at the owl, say, “whoooo, whoooo,”  and if she points at the cowboy, say, “Howdy.”)  She’ll probably never let you finish reading a book to her, but she enjoys when you point at things and tell her what they are.
Things she’s not allowed to do:
Important: crawl on the sidewalk while wearing shoes.  Climb over the sides of the couch.  Play with my iPad.  Put electronic things in her mouth.  Pull books off the shelf with the stereo.  Walk around with the little Tic Tac Toe pegs in her mouth.  Touch other babies faces.  Hit people.
Unimportant or Stuff She Doesn’t Really Do Anyway: Play in anything on the desk or behind the desk chair except for her blue Pooh backpack.    Take things out of cupboards (she can play with things, but she can’t set them on the floor.)  Go in the pantry.  Reach in the toilet, touch the plunger, move the bathroom trash can or extra TP glass jar.  Pull TP off the roll.  Play with chemicals.  Play with outlets.  Pull out diaper wipes.  Open the purple and white box by the mirror in the master bedroom.  Pull stuff off the laundry drying rack.


>7-8  She wakes up.  She might wake up sooner, but she doesn’t need to come out until she sounds distressed.
Diaper change (which she will protest at.)  Extra diapers and wipes in the boxes behind you, Desitin is on the desk behind you.  Use it if her skin is red, after you blow dry her bum.    Dirty diapers go in the pantry, in the 5 gallon bucket with the plastic bag.
Outfit change.  Pants are in the bottom drawer of the dresser, socks in the top, shirts hanging in the closet.
Breakfast.  Heidi loves oatmeal.  If you know how to make it, there are oats in the cupboard above the microwave on the top shelf.  She’ll eat, I don’t know, ¾ cup of oats?  (measured dry) with a spoonful or two of brown sugar and some salt sprinkled on.  Cover with water, microwave for 2:30.  (Press these buttons: Stop, Power, 2, 3, 0, Start).  She’ll also want some milk.  Her sippy cup is either (in order of likelihood) in the fridge with some milk left in it, by or in the sink, in the drainer, in the cupboard above the knife block, in the cupboard above the microwave, in the cupboard above the oven.)   If you want to give her some fruit too, she’ll like oranges, pears, bananas, little bits of apple, watermelon, strawberries, blueberries… depending on what we have.
Pray before eating.  She should start out folding her arms, but she might give up in the middle and start eating or playing.  We’re okay with this for now.
If she stops feeding herself, feed her a few more bites with a fork or a spoon, stop when she shakes her head.  Ask her if she wants Out. She’ll pull her finger out of her other hand and say “Ow?”
Scoot her away from the table, get your hand wet, wipe off her face and hands, rinsing off your hand as often as needed.  (Then wash your hands… when I forget, I get sick.)

>First nap.  Right now, this is kind of variable.  A good naptime is 10 am.  But if she is rubbing her eyes, yawning, and being extremely cranky before then, stick her in bed for a rest.  She probably won’t sleep, but she won’t be tired or cranky anymore.  She’ll need another nap at 11 or 12.
You don’t have to take her out of her crib until she sounds distressed.  She sometimes stays in there for a long time, just playing with her monkey.  I think this is okay.
The first nap can be put off until noon, if you’re outside or on an errand or doing something really fun.

>11:30 Lunchtime.  Unless she’s sleeping. She’ll like to eat leftovers, (middle shelf in the fridge) fruit (basket or plate by the oven), canned beans (pantry), canned green beans (cupboard above oven), canned corn (cupboard above oven), ½ slice toast with butter and honey (bread either in the fridge or the cupboard above the microwave, butter in the fridge, honey in the cupboard above the microwave), hot dogs (in the fridge, microwave for 20 s.  Push these buttons: Stop, Power, 2,0, Start), scrambled eggs, cheese cubes, whatever you can find.  The only thing she won’t eat is lettuce.  The only things I don’t want her to eat are treats before she is mostly full and chips (they sometimes get stuck in her throat.)


>Second nap.  Whenever she is rubbing her eyes, yawning, or being cranky.  Try to put her down before three, but if she gets cranky at four, put her down then too.  Wake her up by five, and definitely by five-thirty.

>Dinner.  Same as lunch.

>Bedtime.  Start the routine between 6:30 and 7.  Routine:
1 mL of fluoride vitamins (on the shelf under the mirror in the bathroom.  She likes this.  Don’t let her play with the bottle.  If she spills some on her clothes, change them and soak them in the bathroom sink.
Brush teeth with the little red toothbrush on the same shelf with just water.  She’ll usually let you do this.  If not, stick the toothbrush to something and let her play with it.  She’ll usually brush her teeth herself.  If she’s not brushing, hijack the toothbrush and try to brush just a little bit.  If she really won’t let you, have her drink some water to wash down the medicine.
Wash hands.  Rub some of the Cetaphil stuff (on the same shelf) on her hands and then wash them off.  Don’t let her play with the soap.  Dry hands with a towel.
Check her tummy, back, upper arms, and legs for dry skin.  If you find some, rub on the Advanced Healing Ointment that is on the towel rack.  She’ll want to rub some on her tummy herself or put the lid back on.  This is okay, just make sure it she wipes it all off her hands.
Diaper change.
Change into pajamas.  There should be pants and a shirt on the floor next to the changing pillow.  If not, grab some pants from the bottom drawer, a long sleeve shirt from the closet, and socks from the top drawer.
Go get a story from the front room, stick her in her crib while you read it.  She’ll stand and shout or lay down and snuggle with her monkey.  Whatever.  But during this reading, I like her to listen and look, not hijack the page turning.
Read her a scripture.  There is a Book of Mormon on the dresser.  Expound on the scripture, and bear your testimony of that principle.
Say a prayer, have her fold her arms.
Say goodnight, and leave and shut the door (unless it’s really hot, then open all the windows and leave the door open.)  She doesn’t have to be laying down, but make sure she has her pacifier and monkey.
She might wimper at night.  Go in if she starts crying and doesn’t sound like she’s going to stop.  Find the pacifier using your cell phone or something, stick it in her mouth, and she should quiet down.  If she doesn’t, take her out and comfort her until she stops crying or the monkey will make her stop crying.  (This is rare, she’s only needed it twice in her life.  Usually the pacifier will quiet her.)

While I was studying Preach My Gospel, I wondered what key indicators would be
for stay-at-home-moms. Here's what I came up with in 2011.
