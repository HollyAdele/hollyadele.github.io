When I was looking at cars, I researched about car mechanics--just enough to know
when there is a serious problem that you want or don't want to own.  This was
my calculator to create an objective way to decide which car to buy after inspecting
it.

>Start at 100

>Noted, but not serious
If there are less than 4, multiply by 2 and subtract.
If there are between 4 and 8, multiply by 3 and subtract.
If there are more than 8, multiply by 4 and subtract.

>If there are less than 3, multiply by 2 and subtract.
If there are between 3 and 5, multiply by 6 and subtract.
If there are more than 5, multiply by 10 and subtract.

>Serious Issues
If there are less than 3, multiply by 25 and subtract.
If there are 3 or more, multiply by 50 and subtract.

>Deal Breakers
If there are no deal breakers, multiply score by 1.
If there are any deal breakers, multiply total score by 0.
