I was born in Colorado and attended Brigham Young University for college.  I majored
in elementary education, and now I teach four students, my Heidi, my Peter, my Austin, and my Erika.

I'm married to a web developer and we live in the Mid-West.  

I love to eat, read, and sleep. Back to basics, right?
